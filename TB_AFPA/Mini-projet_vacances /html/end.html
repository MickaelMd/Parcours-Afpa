            Strongholds are structures that generate naturally in the overworld.
            <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/Stronghold.png"
              alt="Strongholds"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            They spawn in rings. <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/Minecraft_Stronghold_Generation.png"
              alt="Stronghold Generation"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            If you followed the ender eye perfectly you will dig down to the
            starting staircase of the stronghold. <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/eyes.png"
              alt="eye"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a staircase which extends into a room which has 5 possible
            rooms extending from it. <br />
            <br />
            Mainly you want to just go through rooms looking for the end portal
            room. <br />
            <br />
            Up to 4 stronghold chests can spawn and they can contain ender
            pearls, apples and bread mainly. <br />
            <br />
            The main principle for finding the end portal room is that it must
            spawn at least 5 rooms from the starting staircase, but tends to
            spawn within 7 or 8 rooms from it so you shouldn't go too deep into
            the stronghold looking for it and should return to the starter
            staircase and choose a different route. <br />
            <br />
            There can be quite a lot of variance and randomness with finding the
            portal. <br />
            <br />
            Once you find the end portal, there will be 12 end portal frames.
            Each of these frames has a 10% chance to contain an eye pre-filled.
            <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/portal_end.png"
              alt="Portal End"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            This means you will need at most 12 eyes of ender to fill the end
            portal and because of the way the probabilities work, it is quite
            unreliable to rely on 2 or more eyes.

          <h1>Ender Dragon Fight</h1>
          <p>
            You will need to have gathered some resources at some point
            throughout the run. <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/end.png"
              alt="End"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            Minimal resources are some beds which you can use to "one cycle" the
            dragon. <br />
            <br />
            This works since beds explode when you try to sleep with them in the
            end. <br />
            <br />
            This means when the dragon flies to the middle, you place a bed on
            the bedrock and explode it at the right time, dealing damage to the
            dragon and pushing it up so you can use another bed to also deal
            damage and push up the dragon again. This can take a lot of practice
            and the best runners can consistently kill the dragon in 4-5 beds.
            <br />
          </p>

          <div class="embedtool">

          <p id="p_fight">
            <br />
            Probably the easiest way to kill the dragon is to have a bow and at
            least 32 arrows. <br />
            <br />
            Then you can shoot arrows at the end crystals to take them down
            while making sure to not look at the endermen and move away when the
            dragon shoots dragon breath at you. <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/crystal_end.png"
              alt="crystal end"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            When the dragon perches you can move around to the side or behind
            the dragon to enter the fountain underneath the dragon and hit it
            with an axe or sword until it flies away. <br />
            <br />
            If you are not in the fountain when it flies away from the fountain
            be careful since it will fly towards you, potentially knocking you
            up into the air. <br />
            <br />
            As long as you've shot down every crystal the dragon won't heal.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that when shooting at the dragon or hitting it with an
            axe/sword hitting its head does much more damage than hitting its
            body. <br />
            <img
              class="clickable-image"
              src="../assets/img/dead_dragon.png"
              alt="dead dragon"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            After killing the dragon and you enter the end portal, timing ends
            and you've completed a speedrun! There are still many, many
            advanced, complex and varied strategies left unmentioned here.
